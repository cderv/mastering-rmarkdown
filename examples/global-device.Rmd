title: "Using a global graphical device to record plots"
---

First, turn on a global graphical device:

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(global.device = TRUE)
```

Draw a plot:

```{r}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.1, 0.1))
plot(cars)
```

Add a line to the plot in the previous code chunk:

```{r}
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
abline(fit)
```

No longer use the global device:

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(global.device = FALSE)
```

Draw another plot:

```{r}
plot(pressure, type = 'b')
```
